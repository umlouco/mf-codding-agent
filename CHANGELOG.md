# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Stop an executor after three identical tool failures instead of allowing a malformed call to consume the full round budget.
- Automatically accept complete structured PASS evidence, avoiding a second LLM rejecting successful checks for presentation-only reasons.
- Keep retry round ceilings fixed and show detailed live activity plus cache reads separately in task rows.
- Enforce each task's maximum-attempt limit and stop the run for review instead of retrying forever.

Tool-surface changes aimed at one failure mode: the agent routing work through
shell scripts and Python heredocs instead of the tools built for it, then
explaining the detour with invented facts about the tools.

- **The permission gate is gone.** `Tool.Confirm`, `Env.Ask`, the
  `permission/request` round-trip and the `autoApprove` setting are all removed;
  nothing asks before it runs. In practice nothing did: both the chat and the
  queue were already sending `autoApprove: ['*']`, and the chat never registered
  a `permission/request` handler at all — so a narrowed `autoApprove` would have
  failed tool calls with `method not found` rather than prompting. The code now
  matches what the product does.
- In its place, every tool call reports a one-line summary as it starts, from the
  tool's own `Summarize`, shown in the chat next to the tool name. Notice rather
  than consent, but it is written by the tool and knows what the webview cannot
  infer — which `unix` scripts write, how many lines a `write_file` is.
- `unix` scripts are still classified as reading or writing from the parsed
  script, now to decide execution order (writes are sequenced against the edits
  around them, reads run in parallel) and to produce that summary.
- Refusals from `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` and `multi_edit` now name
  the call that gets past them, and say outright that the shells reach the same
  files through the same root, so writing around a refusal is not a fix.
- `grep` gains `output_mode` (`content` / `files` / `count`), `capture` for pulling
  one regex group out of every match on a line, and `unique` for deduplicating and
  counting distinct values. Counting ignores the result limit so the total is
  exact. `files_only` still works as an alias for `output_mode: "files"`.
- `run_shell` runs in a real VS Code terminal when shell integration is available,
  inheriting the user's own shell, profile and `PATH`, and staying on screen to be
  watched and scrolled back through. Falls back to spawning a shell otherwise, and
  reports `exit=unknown` rather than assuming success when no exit status is
  available. New setting: `mfagent.shell.useTerminal`. Requires VS Code 1.93.
- The system prompt no longer suggests a Python script for questions that `grep`
  answers, and asks for a disagreeing count to be reported rather than re-derived.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- Graph memory (Observations / Retrieval / Substrate tiers), scoped per workspace
- File, search, POSIX shell, real shell, browser and MCP tools
- Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral,
  Groq, xAI, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, Voyage, or any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint), with per-role provider/model binding and reasoning-effort
  control
- Autonomous task queue backed by SQLite, with a supervisor loop that retries, splits
  or rolls back tasks until every one verifies — no attempt limit, no terminal failure
- Executor-owned validation: executors run code, commands, tests, and browser checks,
  persist structured evidence in SQLite, and tool-less supervisors only judge that evidence
- Bundled task-queue MCP now exposes an atomic, schema-rich plan writer with dry-run,
  append/replace modes, verification criteria, annotations, and structured results
- Project instructions from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.mfagent/instructions.md`
- Optional notify command on autonomous-run completion
